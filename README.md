HomeQuest is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb and other travel platforms. It’s designed to help users list, discover, and manage stays — built entirely using the MERN stack.
My main focus during this project was creating strong end-to-end backend services with clean, scalable code.

✨ Current Features in HomeQuest:

1️⃣ Basic signup, login, and logout functionalities
2️⃣ Listing your property with essential details
3️⃣ Editing or deleting listings anytime
4️⃣ Search feature to find the right stay (to be refined as more data comes in)
5️⃣ Interactive map 🗺️ to trace listings
6️⃣ Review system for user feedback

🚀 What’s Next (Phase 2 in Progress):

1️⃣ Full functionality for category filters
2️⃣ Integrated calendar system 📅 for bookings
3️⃣ A more engaging and modern frontend

⚙️ Tech & Integrations:

Cloudinary → for image & video uploads

Mapbox API → for map and location tracking

MongoDB Atlas + Render → for deployment

Bootstrap → for flash messages and responsive UI components

MDN Docs & npm → my constant go-tos for debugging and learning

💭 Honest Confession:

The project may look simple right now — but that’s intentional. Like Airbnb’s early version, HomeQuest focuses on a clean, minimal, and highly responsive user experience before scaling up.

A fun moment: I once spent 30 minutes debugging because I wrote "mehtod" instead of "method" 😅 — shoutout to ChatGPT for catching it instantly!
